# MapboxAnnotationClustering
This repository sample app demonstrates an issue with view Annotations and clustering

# Usage
- add the `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN` as property to a file called `local.properties` in your root folder
- Run the app and observe one view annotation missing when the zoom animation is finished (with clustering enabled).
- Run the app once more without clustering enabled and observe both view annotations being present
